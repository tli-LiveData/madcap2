        <h1>Hotspot Popups</h1>
        <p class="note"><span class="Emphasis">Note: </span>Hotspot topic popups are not supported in some online outputs or in print-based outputs. In HTML5, they do not work if you are using a main skin (e.g., Side Navigation, Top Navigation, Tripane), so the HTML5 output in this project is set up to be skinless (in that it doesn't use a main skin). </p>
        <p>There are many places to visit in Austin. Three of these are the State Capitol, Zilker Park, and Lady Bird Lake. Click on the numbered circles on the map to learn about each.</p>
