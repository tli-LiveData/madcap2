        <p>In 1839, an area named "Waterloo" was selected as the capital of the Republic of Texas, replacing Houston. It was then named "Austin," after Stephen F. Austin, known as the "Father of Texas."</p>
        <p>During the 1800s, Austin saw an increase in population and economic growth. The Texas State Capitol and University of Texas at Austin were born. By the late 20th century, the city became a hub for technology, business, and live music.</p>
